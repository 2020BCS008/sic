\section{Introduction}
This assignment demonstrates a 3-node system using Python’s socket programming. It simulates communication through TCP and UDP protocols. The system tracks packet loss and uses Wireshark to analyze network traffic. Node 1 sends data over TCP to Node 2, which forwards it over UDP to Node 3. Node 3 receives and tracks packet loss, ensuring the system models real-world network conditions effectively.
\subsection{Node 1: TCP Server}
Node 1 functions as a TCP server that listens for client connections. It receives data from a client and forwards it to Node 2 via TCP. This node generates the data packets that are sent to the next node for further processing.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Listens for UDP packets from Node 2.
    \item Tracks received packets and detects losses based on sequence numbers.
    \item Prints received and lost packet statistics.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Node 2: TCP-to-UDP Forwarder}
Node 2 receives data from Node 1 over TCP, then forwards it to Node 3 using the UDP protocol. It simulates packet loss with a 10\% drop rate to mimic network instability, making this node an intermediary in the communication.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Receives data from Node 1 via TCP.
    \item Forwards data to Node 3 via UDP.
    \item Simulates packet loss.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Node 3: UDP Receiver with Packet Loss Tracking}
Node 3 is responsible for receiving UDP packets from Node 2. It tracks the number of packets received and identifies lost packets by comparing the expected sequence number with the actual received packets. It prints out the total number of received and lost packets.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Listens for incoming TCP connections.
    \item Receives and forwards data to Node 2.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Wireshark Analysis}
Wireshark is used to capture and visualize the network traffic between the nodes. It provides insights into the transmitted packets, helping confirm the packet loss and verify the system’s behavior under network conditions.
Wireshark allows us to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Capture live network traffic in real-time.
    \item Analyze specific protocol packets such as TCP and UDP.
    \item Inspect packet contents and verify the integrity of data transmission.
    \item Track packet loss and retransmissions across the network.
\end{itemize}
