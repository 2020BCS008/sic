$ perf stat -e cpu-clock ./matrix_multiply
This command measures the CPU clock cycles while executing the matrix_multiply program, providing insights into the processor's usage.

$ perf record -e cpu-clock,faults ./matrix_multiply
This command records performance data, including CPU clock cycles and memory access faults (like page faults) during the execution of matrix_multiply.

$ perf stat -e cache-misses ./matrix_multiply
This command tracks cache misses while running the matrix_multiply program, helping to understand how often data needs to be fetched from slower memory due to cache misses.
